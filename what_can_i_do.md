<h3> Overview of the space </h3>

<p> There are different subareas and research approaches within the field of AI alignment, and you may be a better fit for some than others.</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Some categories within the field:</li>
		<ul> 
			<li><b>Empirical research and engineering</b> (e.g. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, <a href="far.ai">FAR AI</a>, <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/">Google DeepMind's alignment teams</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/">OpenAI's alignment teams</a>, <a href="safe.ai">Center for AI Safety (CAIS)</a>, <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/">Redwood Research</a>)</li>
			<li><b>Empirical research and engineering aimed at evaluations of AI capabilities and alignment; technical AI governance work</b> (e.g. <a href="https://evals.alignment.org/">ARC Evals</a>, <a href="https://www.apolloresearch.ai/">Apollo Research</a>, <a href="https://palisaderesearch.org/">Palisade Research</a></li>
			<li><b>Technical AI governance</b> outside of evaluations, which includes technical standards development (e.g. <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy">Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy</a>, <a href="https://epochai.org/">forecasting</a>, <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/information-security/">information security</a>, and <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BJtekdKrAufyKhBGw/ai-governance-needs-technical-work">other work</a>)</li>
			<li><b>Theoretical research</b> (e.g. <a href="https://alignment.org/">Alignment Research Center</a>, <a href="https://intelligence.org/">MIRI</a>, and many independent researchers.) </li>
		</ul> 
	<li><b>Academia</b> (e.g. UC Berkeley's <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">CHAI</a>, NYU's <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/arg/">Alignment Research Group</a>, <a href="https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/">Jacob Steinhardt</a>, <a href="https://www.davidscottkrueger.com/">David Krueger</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/"> FOCAL</a> and <a href="https://www.cooperativeai.com/foundation">Cooperative AI Foundation</a>) often includes theoretical work and empirical work that doesn't require access to large-scale infrastructure.</li>
	<li><b>Engineering</b> aimed at AI alignment is almost always in industry, and <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YDF7XhMThhNfHfim9/ai-safety-needs-great-engineers">ML engineering</a> and research engineers are especially in-demand, but there's also <a href="https://jobs.80000hours.org/?refinementList%5Btags_area%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20safety%20%26%20policy&refinementList%5Btags_skill%5D%5B0%5D=Software%20engineering">a range</a> of engineering roles, especially security, and also software.</li>

<div id="governance"><h2> AI Governance </h2>

<p>The Center for the Governance of AI (<a href="https://www.governance.ai/">GovAI</a>) describes the AI governance problem as "the problem of devising global norms, policies, and institutions to best ensure the beneficial development and use of advanced AI" (<a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/614b70a71b9f71c9c240c7a7/61d48553bf2faf58c3900bd2_GovAI-Research-Agenda.pdf">GovAI Research Agenda</a>). "AI governance" is distinct from "AI policy" in its primary focus on advanced AI — the hypothetical general purpose technology — rather than current AI as it exists today. The field believes that different actions, risks, and opportunities come about when focusing on advanced AI systems as compared to more contemporary issues, though <a href="https://www.allandafoe.com/opportunity">AI governance and AI policy naturally interface with each other and have overlapping domains</a>.</p>
