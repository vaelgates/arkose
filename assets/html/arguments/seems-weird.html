<blockquote>
Surely there are all kinds of sci-fi scenarios on machines that think. From what I see in the field of ML, I just can’t imagine a world where machines are truly intelligent in the sense that humans are. It seems really weird.

<ul><li>At first glance, the prospect of generally capable systems like a “CEO AI” seems quite far-fetched. Like all extraordinary claims, it would require very strong evidence.</li>
<li>However, despite that initial reaction, there are reasons why it might make sense to be more open to the possibility than intuition would suggest.</li>
<li>(TODO add links to all of these)</li>
<li>There are reasons to think that this century might be a special one in the history of humanity. </li>
<li>The amount of resources invested into AI are increasing rapidly, meaning that the most transformative AI advances are perhaps still in the future. A report looking only at the amount of resources invested highlights that the history of AI is short and investment is increasing rapidly - meaning the most transformative AI advances are perhaps still in the future.</li>
<li>One reason truly intelligent machines might seem wild is that they might change the world very rapidly, and it seems unlikely based upon past experiences that such quick change is possible.<br/>TODO think about that some more - despite our discussion at the call lately, I struggle with this point a bit. </li>
<li>While AI has been overhyped before, the hype implied by some of the well-known predictions from the early days of AI is <a href='https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/what-should-we-learn-from-past-ai-forecasts/' target='_blank'>commonly exaggerated</a>.</li>
<li><li>In a <a href='https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/#Summary_of_results' target='_blank'>2022 survey of AI researchers</a>, the aggregate forecasted time until human-level AI was 37 years (2059).</li>
<li>A <a href='https://www.cold-takes.com/are-we-trending-toward-transformative-ai-how-would-we-know/#surveying-experts' target='_blank'>survey from 2017</a> asked for ““when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers" and got 20% probability by 2036, 50% by 2060, and 70% by 2100.</li>
