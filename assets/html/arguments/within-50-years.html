<ul><li>We have been working on AI since 1950. The deep learning revolution started in 2012. On the scale of human history (e.g. Agricultural Revolution ~12,000 years ago, Industrial Revolution ~200 years ago), this is not much time, and <a href='https://venturebeat.com/ai/report-ai-investments-see-largest-year-over-year-growth-in-20-years/' target='_blank'>investments increased massively since 2010</a>.</li>
<li>We now have unprecedented and unpredicted progress in large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. For example, PaLM is able to explain novel jokes in two-shot prompts.</li>
<li>PaLM has also shown that new capabilities can emerge entirely as a function of scale, without major innovations in the underlying paradigm. Prior research suggested this was a possibility, but PaLM has demonstrated that this still holds at very large model size and with high amounts of training data.</li>
