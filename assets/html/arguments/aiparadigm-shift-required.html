I think currently, the way AI problems are defined is also more in the nature of pattern recognition than general intelligence, right? Like Translate is a one-to-one mapping, even image classification is just like, looking at an image data, tell me what it is, and that kind of stuff. But general intelligence is a lot more things. It's like, learning how to... Not just knowing what to say, in a particular situation, for instance, but being able to have a conversation deciding which of the alternatives, of things you say, will lead in a particular direction. And even, I mean, It involves a lot of emotional aspects also, right? Like empathy, compassion, or even negative aspects like jealousy, and rancor, and stuff like that. But I mean, it involves a lot of things, which, like I said, I don't think can be put in the form of a mathematical problem. So I think the current approach to AI, which is “take a task, make a mathematical formulation, and then solve it,” isn't really suitable for general intelligence.

<p>A paradigm shift might be necessary before AI researchers can develop AGI. But that paradigm shift could come in just twenty years—or ten. This is soon enough to make AGI a significant concern now . We cannot know when these paradigm shifts occur, nor just how many (or few) new insights will be required.</p>
<p>Despite the need for significant innovation, overall investment in AI technology is significant and growing, and it seems likely we will eventually achieve AGI.</p>
