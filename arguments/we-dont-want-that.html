<blockquote>
”Maybe in a 100 years, when we've explored all of these problems, then we'll be so bored that we say, ’Can we engineer something that contains all of these different domain expert AIs in one, in a way that can-- those AIs can respond to a question and affect behavior in the world and have their own free will.’ It's more of a philosophical pursuit that I don't even, I don't... okay, so from an economic standpoint, I don't know who's going to pay for that. Even the military would be like, ‘All I want is a drone that's going to kill everybody.’"

<ul><li>There are several well-funded companies explicitly trying to build AGI, most notably: <a href='https://openai.com/about/' target='_blank'>OpenAI</a> and <a href='https://www.deepmind.com/about' target='_blank'>DeepMind</a>. The field is growing - for example, game developer John Carmack (who does not have notable AI experience) has founded <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/john-carmack-agi-keen-raises-20-million-from-sequoia-nat-friedman-and-others/' target='_blank'>an AGI company with an initial investment of $20M</a>. And China is following a <a href='https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-advanced-ai-research/' target='_blank'>strategy of world leadership in AI</a>, including the pursuit of general AI.</li>
<li>As consumers, we usually prefer more general systems. For example:</li>
<ul><li>People prefer smartphones with many capabilities over simple phones</li>
<li>Google Maps and Google Calendar are good separately. But they are better if they can be combined. And they would be even better if they had the capability, without prompt, to automatically call an Uber and figure out your travel directions</li>
<li>Desktop PC operating systems like MacOS and Windows initially only had a small range of software available, and they were only capable of interfacing with a small number of hardware devices. Over the years, the options in both hardware and software increased enormously.</li>
</ul><li>AGI has important advantages over an assembly of task-based AIs.</li>
