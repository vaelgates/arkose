<div>Indeed, it is somewhat plausible that we would get these advanced systems well before the end of the 21st century. Reasons for that include:</div>
<ul><li>We have been working on AI since 1950. The deep learning revolution started in 2012. This is not much time, and investments <a href='https://venturebeat.com/ai/report-ai-investments-see-largest-year-over-year-growth-in-20-years/' target='_blank'>investments increased massively since 2010</a>.</li>
<li>We now have unprecedented, and unpredicted progress in large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM. For example, PaLM is able to explain novel jokes in two-shot propts.</li>
<li>PaLM has also shown that new capabilities can emerge just as a function of scale, without major innovations in the underlying paradigm required.</li>
