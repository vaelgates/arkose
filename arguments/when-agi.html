<p>This is our first argument. After reading it, you can select an answer at the bottom of the page. Depending on your answer, you will be guided to different sections.</p>
<ul><li>Current AI systems are fairly narrow in that they might be very strong in a particular task, but do not come close to covering the full spectrum of human ability.</li>
<li>When we think about the future of AI, one of the promises is getting very generally capable systems. These systems might have the cognitive capabilities to replace almost all current human jobs—for example, you could have a CEO AI or a scientist AI (whether or not we choose to actually replace humans).</li>
