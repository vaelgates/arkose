<div>This is the first page in an interactive guide to AI safety arguments. Each page will present a different argument or counter-argument. This is meant to mimic a conversation: At the bottom of the page, you can select between several answers or counterarguments.</div>

<ul><li>Current AI systems are fairly narrow in that they might be very strong in a particular task, but do not come even close to covering the full spectrum of human ability.</li>
<li>When we think about the future of AI, one of the promises is getting very generally capable systems. These systems might have the cognitive capabilities to replace almost all current human jobs - so for example, you could have a CEO AI or a scientist AI (whether or not we choose to actually replace humans).</li>
</ul><div><em>When do you think these generally capable systems will exist?</em></div>
