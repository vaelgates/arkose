<div>V: The way you have it written seems like it's maybe also trying to make the point that AGI could be a BIG DEAL, and I think I want to make that point separately, with concrete examples for people to visualize? I don't actually push that very hard in my interviews, I realize, but that kind of goes along with the "let's talk about threat models and  existential risk"  / let's talk about "as transformative as the industrial revolution"So while I don't feel like I have a good grasp of what you're going for this section, very naively I'm like "break this up into the timelines portion and push that up, and the "this is a big deal" portion and push that down into threat models"</div>
[ https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1912/1912.00747.pdf ] compares the future development of transformative AI with previous technological innovations. They emphasize that the industrial revolution produced sudden changes in global average GDP - change of a kind never before seen in human history. The authors further argue that this kind of change has “practically irreversible change in trajectories of human life and progress”. “Practically irreversible” might mean, among other things, that products and services become so embedded in society that our lives become dependent on them. An example of that from the past would be electricity.
<div>Even narrow AI might already have a transformative effect on society. This is particularly true if AI is used to speed up technological progress [ https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-whats-the-burden-of-proof/ ].</div>
