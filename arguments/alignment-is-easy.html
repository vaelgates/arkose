<p>The alignment problem might seem easy to solve at first glance. However, as more and more people have researched it, we have uncovered a wide range of problems, including some which might not be obvious at first glance.</p>
For example: An AI system can be deceptively aligned, i.e. display safe behaviour in the training environment but then do the wrong thing in the testing environment. This sounds far-fetched, but is a natural consequence of assuming that future systems will have high amounts of intelligence and an accurate model of the world.
<ul><li>An AI employing deception may like a far-fetched scenario. However, forms of deception have already been observed even in relatively simple systems: In <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03453' target='_blank'>The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution</a>, Ofria recounts their experience from a 2001 simulated biology study published in Nature. In this study, evolutionary programming led to organisms being able to detect whether or not they are in the training environment, and radically change their behaviour based on that. This is an example of deception arising from training pressures, without even requiring general intelligence.</li>
<li>In <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111' target='_blank'>Goal Misgeneralization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> (ICML 2022), Longosco et al provide the first empirical demonstrations of goal misgeneralization: In a simple toy environment, an agent learns the wrong objective due to slight distributional shifts between training and testing environment. This system is not an AGI with an intention to deceive - nevertheless, the outcome is the same: The system displays safe behaviour in training but goes for the wrong goal in the testing environment.</li>
<li>If we look at a hypothetical AGI system, it is conceivable that it would form an intent to deceive. The reason is that in order to have general intelligence, will probably need to be aware about its own inner workings and its place in the world. This world model will include the AI itself as part of that world model, and as an object of its own decisions. That means, whether or not it gets deployed will influence the world and the goals the AI cares about. It might recognize that it will not get deployed unless it behaviour in the training environment is satisfactory. So “satisfactory behaviour in the training environment” might be something the AI explicitely optimizes for, while exhibiting different behaviour in the testing environment.</li>

<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01790' target='_blank'><li>Goal Misgeneralization: Why Correct Specifications Aren't Enough For Correct Goals</a> - 2022 preprint by Rohin Shah (DeepMind) et al. They provide several examples for goal misgeneralization in present-day deep learning systems.</li>
<li>The ICML paper mentioned above was popularized in a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkbPdEHEyEI]' target='_blank'>YouTube video by AI researcher Robert Miles</a>.<br/></li></ul></ul>
<p>Obviously, much of this research is conceptual and we do not have any actual AGI systems to test our hypotheses on. That being said, a lot of these insights are independent of the particulars of AI architecture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the alignment problem could be solved easily, it is not clear that the solution will be found in time:</p>
<ul><li>There is a significant resource gap between work on safety, compared to work on capabilities. <br/><li>At the moment, very few people are working on the safety of future general AI systems (as opposed to improving ethical alignment of current narrow systems). It might be only around 300, while 10-100x as many people work on speeding up the progress towards general AI (see <a href='https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1489985966714544134?lang=en' target='_blank'>one estimate here</a>, <a href='https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/' target='_blank'>another one here</a>). Obviously, there is no proof that advanced AI systems will cause catastrophe. We are not dealing with certainties here. But there are arguments from multiple directions indicating that there is at least some level of risk, and the consequences might be catastrophic. For a technology with such impacts, it seems like safety research is neglected.<br/></li></li>
</ul><p>And even if a solution is found in time, it might not be implemented correctly: Due to economic incentives, new technologies  are often deployed without adequate confirmation of safety, especially if people don’t think it needs to be carefully checked.</p>
