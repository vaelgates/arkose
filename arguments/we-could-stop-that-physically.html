<div>0:28:48.9 Interviewee: I have a very naïve answer to this. Ultimately, all these things are controlled by power, where they need energy to function. I think there's a very simple source to cut them off from the system, so we do have control over them in that sense. </div>

<ul><li>An AI that has some sort of general intelligence, can act in the world but is of lower than human intelligence could possibly be stopped. Just like humans can catch a tiger and keep it in a cage - not because they are stronger, but because they are smarter than the tiger.</li>
<li>However, most of the benefits of AGI will arise from intelligence levels that are human or beyond. Therefore, there is tremendous economic pressure to work towards that kind of intelligence level.</li>
<li>If the AGI is more intelligent than a human, then this would include its ability to understand how others would act and react accordingly.</li>
<li>So by definition it can think of ways to prevent shutdown that take into account what we would do, and work around that.</li>
<li>Even a human could come up with strategies that could work against other humans! For example:<br/>1. Play nice for a few weeks<br/>2. Solve important problems for your human operators<br/>3. Gain internet access<br/>4. Copy yourself onto many other machines covertly</li>
<li>Here’s more examples of possible strategies:</li>
<ul><li>Trick a single of your human operators to make a change to the system, which would enable you to disable the stop button</li>
<li>Pay a company to construct something physical (like a robot) that can be used to fight whoever tries to shut you down</li>
<li>Make a lot of money on the stock market (using superior speed and information processing capabilities), then buy the company that operates you and fire anyone who wants to shut you down.</li>
