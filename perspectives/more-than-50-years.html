I think we're still a solid century behind that. Yeah, I don't know. I just feel like it's still a solid century behind because that might require a huge paradigm shift in how we're training our models.

I guess at least 50 years. Because, yeah, I think there is some level of strong intelligence we can achieve within 50 years, but for fully automated intelligence I guess at least 50 years.

I think current deep learning may face some problems. I'm not thinking that we can continue this way or that deep learning is the final solution to general artificial intelligence. But I think in maybe 50 years or longer we can achieve such a level of human intelligence.

<p>It is difficult to predict any new technology. That said, there are reasons to think that general artificial intelligence may be developed within the next 50 years.</p>
