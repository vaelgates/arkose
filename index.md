            <blockquote class="testimonial">AI Safety/Alignment is an active field with diverse perspectives. The Arkose website has a resourceful collection of some of the most relevant papers, jobs, companies and grants, which I found very handy. I gained much clarity when I interacted with the Arkose team over a call and debated on some of the safety issues. I would highly recommend the supportive Arkose team for anyone hoping to enter the field.</blockquote>

          <li class="glide__slide">
            <blockquote class="testimonial">Vael had an excellent understanding of the alignment landscape, and useful insight into the skills and background required for working at top AI safety labs. It was really helpful to understand where I needed to be, and Vael offered lots of suggestions to help me get there, including connecting me to people. Advice was well-tailored towards mid/late career ML professionals, who may not be as suited to commonly suggested entry-routes into technical AI safety research.</blockquote>

          </li>
          <li class="glide__slide">
            <blockquote class="testimonial">Once I realized that my research vision closely resembles that of the AI alignment and safety community, I faced the substantial task of understanding that community's distinct culture and identifying related funding opportunities. Over a few calls and emails with Vael at Arkose, I quickly gained an initial map of AI alignment and safety as well as crucial guidance on its navigation. The downstream impact has been immense.</blockquote>

          <li class="glide__slide">
            <blockquote class="testimonial">I appreciated the amount of understanding Vael had of the whole field and current situation; Vael felt on top of things. It was cool to see Vael's ability to personalize advice for me given the rapid pace that they were getting information and pulling out what was relevant. The call was more than I expected - the most useful part was the <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/quickstart">Quickstart guide</a>, though much of it was useful, and the amount of advice seemed fantastic.</blockquote> — Zhen Ning David Liu, PhD student at the University of Cambridge

          <li class="glide__slide">
            <blockquote class="testimonial" style="font-size: 89%">I'm new to the ecosystem, and Vael has been extremely valuable in connecting me with key people, informing my general approach to strategy, and becoming more efficient and effective at AI safety research. They enabled me to really make the most of my in-person visit to the AI safety community in Berkeley: I've been able to get in touch with some key people and come up with resources for the AI safety research that I'm doing, which has significantly accelerated my research efforts. Vael's doing a fantastic job of tying in people of the wider community and I'm very grateful for their services.</blockquote>

            <blockquote class="testimonial">As someone who is relatively new to alignment research, the call with Arkose was more than worth the time. Loads of useful pointers, honest feedback and an overall pleasant call experience. Definitely helped me to refine my plan to transition into the field!</blockquote> - Anonymous

          <li class="glide__slide">
            <blockquote class="testimonial">After a call with Vael, I feel considerably better prepared for my planned career change into AI safety. Vael had a clear view of the whole field and the possible routes into research, and was able to talk in a lot of detail about the routes I was most interested in but also suggest new ones that I had not considered. Best of all, they helped me to put together a series of actionable steps to make progress with my career change. I strongly recommend applying to speak with Arkose if you are looking to move into the field. </blockquote> — Hannes Whittingham, ML Scientist

            <blockquote class="testimonial">It was really interesting and helpful talking with [Vael]. Thank you very much for your time, input, and also the resources. Having the chance to talk with a like-minded, knowledgeable person that can think outside the box and also shares my concerns was a great experience. The provided links are also very helpful, and I plan to spend significant time processing them. It was also a good opportunity to discuss my own ideas and get feedback on them. </blockquote> — Wolfgang Slany, Professor at Graz University of Technology
