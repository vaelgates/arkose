        <p>Arkose is an early-stage, AI safety field-building nonprofit, with the mission of reducing risks from advanced AI. Our approach encompasses a range of activities and responsibilities, primarily involving surveys, calls, and supportive programs. A major organizational focus is supporting researchers interested in contributing to AI safety.</p>

        <p>Our 2022 work aimed to facilitate discussion and evaluation of potential risks from advanced AI, with a focus on soliciting and engaging with expert perspectives on the arguments and providing resources for stakeholders. Our results, based on a set of 97 interviews with AI researchers on their perspectives on current AI and the future of AI (pre-ChatGPT era), can be found at <a href="ai-risk-discussions">AI Risk Discussions</a>.</p>

        <p>Arkose was founded by Dr. <a href="https://vaelgates.com">Vael Gates</a>, and operates as a project of Players Philanthropy Fund, a Maryland charitable trust recognized by IRS as a tax-exempt public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (Federal Tax ID: 27-6601178). Arkose is funded by the Survival and Flourishing Fund.</p>
